### How to add a profile picture

To ensure the portfolio displays correctly, please download a profile picture and save it as `mypic.jpeg` inside this `images` folder.

For a temporary placeholder, you can use a service like [Pravatar](https://pravatar.cc/) or [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) to get a dummy image.

**Example: Pravatar**
1. Go to [https://pravatar.cc/](https://pravatar.cc/)
2. You can use a URL like `https://i.pravatar.cc/300` directly as the `src` for your image, or download it and rename it to `mypic.jpeg`.

**Example: Placeholder.com**
1. Go to [https://placeholder.com/](https://placeholder.com/)
2. Generate an image (e.g., `https://via.placeholder.com/300`).
3. Download the image and rename it to `mypic.jpeg`.

Once you have your desired image, place it in `port/images/mypic.jpeg`.
